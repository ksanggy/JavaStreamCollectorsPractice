/**
 * 7. Flattening, Mapping, and Joining with a Custom Delimiter
 * Problem: Given a list of Author objects, where each author has a list of Book objects,
 * create a single string that lists all books published after a certain year.
 * The string should be formatted as "Author Name: Book Title; Author Name: Book Title; ...".
 * That is, each entry is "Author: Title" and entries are separated by a semicolon and a space.

     * <p/>
     * Previous versions had these issues:
     * 1. First version:
     *    - Used Collectors.flatMapping incorrectly
     *    - Tried to use a combiner function that didn't match the types
     *    - Didn't maintain author information during flattening
     * <p/>
     * 2. Second version:
     *    - Created unnecessary intermediate List with toList()
     *    - Created a second stream from the filtered list
     *    - Used String.join instead of more readable String.format
     *    - Had incorrect year comparison (== instead of >)
     * <p/>
     * Improvements in current version:
     * 1. Efficiency:
     *    - No intermediate collections created
     *    - Direct chaining of stream operations
     *    - Single stream pipeline
     * <p/>
     * 2. Readability:
     *    - Clear string formatting with String.format
     *    - Each operation on its own line
     *    - Descriptive comments
     * <p/>
     * 3. Correctness:
     *    - Proper year comparison (book.publishYear > year)
     *    - Maintains author information throughout
     *    - Correct delimiter format
     *
     * @param authors List of authors with their books
     * @param year The year to filter books after
     * @return Formatted string of books published after the given year
